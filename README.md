# Data Structures
## Description
This repository contains implementations of several popular data structures in the C++ programming language.

- [Project 1](https://github.com/KingLoczek/Data-Structures/tree/main/Project%201) includes the implementation of Array List, Singly Linked List, and Doubly Linked List. Analyzing its computational complexity, the operations of adding and deleting elements at different positions, i.e., at the beginning, the end, and at a random place in the data structure, as well as the operation of searching for an element were considered.
- [Project 2](https://github.com/KingLoczek/Data-Structures/tree/main/Project%202) involves the implementation of a priority queue written on 3 structures: Fibbonaci Heap, Pairing Heap and Binary Heap. The computational complexity analysis includes adding an element, removing and returning the maximum value, reducing the key, finding the maximum value, and obtaining the size of the queue
- [Project 3](https://github.com/KingLoczek/Data-Structures/tree/main/Project%203) includes the implementation of three different hash tables: Closed Addressing with Linked List, Open Addressing with Linear Probing, Cuckoo Hashing. The analysis focuses on the computational complexity of various operations such as inserting and deleting.
