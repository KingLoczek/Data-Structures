# Data Structures
## Description
This repository contains implementations of several popular data structures in the C++ programming language.

- [Project 1](https://github.com/KingLoczek/Data-Structures/tree/main/Project%201) includes the implementation of Array List, Singly Linked List, and Doubly Linked List. Analyzing its computational complexity, the operations of adding and deleting elements at different positions, i.e., at the beginning, the end, and at a random place in the data structure, as well as the operation of searching for an element were considered.

## Instruction
- Clone this project to your local computer.
- Run the code in your development environment.
- You can also customize implementations or use them in your projects.
